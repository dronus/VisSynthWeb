A minimal standalone VisSynth system

Requires a WebGL-capable computer sporting some GPIOs. 
Currently adjusted to run on an Odroid XU4 ARM single board computer.

Four encoder knobs and one 2x40 character LCD display must be wired to the GPIO pins as defined by ui_hardware_client.js. 

A simulation for the browser for evaluating the remote UI without hardware is provided by the VisSynthWeb server at http://SERVER/VisSynthBox/ui_hardware.html .
