A minimal VisSynth remote

Requires an Launchpad MSP432 board connected to a RedPine WiFi module.

Four encoder knobs and one 2x20 character LCD or OLED display must be wired to the GPIO pins as defined by VisSynthRemote.ino

ui_hardware_thin_client_adapter.js must be run with nodejs in addition to the VisSynthWeb server to provide the UDP interface for the remote.

A simulation for the browser for evaluating the remote UI without hardware is provided by the VisSynthWeb server at http://SERVER/VisSynthRemote/ui_hardware_v2.html .
